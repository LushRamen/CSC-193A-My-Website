    <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my webpage where I blog the different types of food I try throughout <strong>Sacramento</strong> 
        and the the <strong>Bay Area cities</strong>. I love exploring new places and food places to eat with my loved ones, and I am excited to share
        my food journey with everyone. The food on here involves a variety of cultural dishes, such as Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese cuisines
        and more, as well as various desserts and drinks I have tried. Below are some links to some of my favorite places to eat in Sacramento. 
        Feel free to try them out for yourself!

        <h2>Asian Cuisines</h2>
        <ul>
          <h3>Vietnamese Food</h3>
          <p>Brief history: The history of Vietnamese cuisine is a rich tapestry of flavors and influences, reflecting the country's diverse history and geography. 
            The cuisine has been influenced by neighboring countries such as China, Cambodia, Laos, and significantly by French cuisine due to French colonial rule 
            from 1887 to 1954. The Chinese introduced several dishes to Vietnam, which were then adapted to local styles and flavors. The French introduced 
            baguettes, which became a popular fast food in Vietnam known as 'bánh mì thịt', and other ingredients like onions, cauliflower, lettuce, potatoes, 
            tarragon, carrot, artichoke, asparagus, and coffee.

            One of the most iconic dishes in Vietnamese cuisine is Phở, a noodle soup that originated in the early 20th century in Northern Vietnam. 
            It was originally sold at dawn and dusk by itinerant street vendors and became popular in South Vietnam after the partition of Vietnam in 1954. Phở 
            was brought to many countries by Vietnamese refugees after the Vietnam War, and restaurants specializing in Phở appeared in numerous Asian enclaves and Little Saigons, such as in Paris and in major cities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. source:https://tryotter.com/resource/wiki/what-is-vietnamese-cuisine#:~:text=History%20of%20Vietnamese%20cuisine&text=The%20cuisine%20has%20been%20influenced,to%20local%20styles%20and%20flavors. </p>
